I've figured out how to rename files and successfully added the code. Now I need to figure out how to duplicate and name the file. I'll have to do this in a new directory as the "waves" directory will trigger the "rename" code if I add anything to it. 

Ignore what's above. 
This script will pull information from a scanned image and add that as a pdf to the "finished Waves" folder, using the information decoded from the barcode to name the document

code has been added to ensure these documents will not be overwritten.
